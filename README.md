The goal of this application was to create a website making use of graphics visualization tools.
I decided to implement a bar chart to visualize a dataset form Awesome JSON Datasets using D3.JS.
I faced some challenges using D3, it wanted the data to be formatted slightly different to the way provided by Awesome JSON datasets. I invested a lot of time trying ro get it to work rgardless, but I did have to change the format of the data to finally get it to work as expected.

I allow the user to manipulate the data visualization in different ways.
- color selection
- bar width
- data sorting
- color change when hovering over
- tooltip showing bar value when hovering over
    - implemented open source d3-tip extension for d3
