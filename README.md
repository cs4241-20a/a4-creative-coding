# basic requirement
Used canvas to add a 2D music visualizer by drawing a circle in the middle, then added the bars around it that has animation and will change according to frequency.
Used Sakura CSS template (the same one from last proj).
User Interface include (6): pause, play, bar color, radius, background color, bar length.
User Interface is displayed as a pop-out alarm when the website is opened. It will pop out again if you press the help button.

# challenge
At first I tried to inplement dat.gui, but then I found that it was much easier if I just parsed the value(change theme? radius length?) and then get then using an id. I spent much time on looking for mp3 sources (which are hard to find..)
