# Cursed Keyboard

Link: https://a4-madeline-perry.glitch.me/

A Halloween-themed web application that allows the user to create spooky sounds using a keyboard interface. The site uses the Web Audio API to create the tones and the piano object provided by Nexus UI. In order to create different tones, the site uses the position of the user's mouse in relation to the keyboard and does some simple math to create a unique tone for each key. The user can also change the shape of the oscillator to one of four options (square, triangle, sawtooth, sine) using the buttons above the keyboard. As an easter egg, the user can make some ghosts appear using the 'Boo!' button underneath the keyboard. 
I had a difficult time getting the keyboard to stop making noise when the user was not clicking it. I read the Nexus UI and Web Audio API documentation and looked at a couple of tutorials but I was not able to get the tones to stop. This is where my idea to make it a 'cursed' keyboard came from, I tried my best to make my uncontrollable keyboard into a feature instead of a bug, but I wouldn't say I'm super satisfied with it. What I was really excited about was implementing the buttons that changed the shape of the oscillator. This worked for me on the first try, so it was really encouraging after struggling with the keyboard component.
