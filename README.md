Goal: Sync Conway's Game of Life with music to provide an audiovisual experience

Challenges: Initially I didnâ€™t realize that each generation would occur simultaneously and not iteratively. Even though my rules were correct, they were executed in an incorrect order. I fixed this by storing a separate array for the next generation. Additionally, to ensure that the pace of propagation syncs up with the music when a user changes tempo, I had to pause everything.

Additional Instructions: Everything should be explained on the info display
