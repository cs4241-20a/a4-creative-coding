## Interactive Population Charts Using D3.js

The goal of the application was to create a visual and interactive display for population datasets. Challenges I faced were in regards to formatting the data to be uniform through each of the charts. The instructions provided on the website are: This website is using a population dataset for India, China, and the United States. The datasets come from https://github.com/jdorfman/Awesome-JSON-Datasets#population This website allows you to compare the populations of the three countries from 1960. You can zoom into each of the country graphs by highlighting the area you wish to see zoomed in- to look at the range more closely. There is also the pie chart that can be manipulated to show the data as you wish. For more user interaction, the user may save the graph or continue toedit the file in an open-source github project.

In terms of the project requirements:
- I used an Express server that includes compression and helmet
- I use the web technology framework D3.js for the interactive data visualizations
- In the user interface I include at least six components that a user can interact with
- The website does load up with a insturctions/guide when the website is loaded up, and is also available as a popup window
- The HTML and CSS do validate,  I used eslint for the JS

## Technical Achievements

- **Multiple Datasets**: Three datasets were used to display the populations of the countries.
- **Used an Open-Source Visualization Tool**: Using https://vega.github.io/editor/#/ to display a pie chart of all the data and allow for the data to be visualized in comparison to other countries that I did not chart.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements

- **Transition background for Color Scheme**: Using JavaScript and CSS I was able to use a color scheme to modulate between a few colors to animate the background.
- **Different ways to interact with website**: The website allows a user to using sliding bars, buttons, and toggles to interact with the website.
