The goal of this application was to have the music be able to visually show in various dots on the screen.
I faced challenges with gettong the music to play. As I could see on my laptop that the music was playing I was unable to actually hear any music from it. 
This also delayed me in working on the visual of this.
I believe there was one small detail I was missing to get this to work, but due to time I was unable to figure it out.

You should be able to play the music using the button provided on the screen.
