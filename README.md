**D.A.N.C.E. Visualizer**
http://a4-chaarke-creative.glitch.me

This website generates a visual based on the 2000s hit D.A.N.C.E. by Justice. The viewer can change the intensity and color of the waveform via a dat.gui interface. 

- The hardest part was importing dat.gui. Several of the methods recommended online did not work, and it required a few hours of messing around to get functional. 
- The next most challenging part was figuring out how to implement showing/hiding a guide. I tried using an eventListener for an afternoon, but ended up integrating with the GUI. 
- Finally, figuring out how to tweak the analyser output to make it look cooler was tricky, but fun. 

While the default settings look pretty cool, I also recommend trying out maximum sensitivity with minimum weight for a neat effect.
