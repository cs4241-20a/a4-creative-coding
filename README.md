Gamelan Synth

I made a synth using the web audio API. My MQP is all software to help play music in different "temperaments" or "tuning systems". So I tuned the synth to Indonesian Gamelan (slendro) tuning.
This tuning is much different than standard western tuning as there are only 5 notes between each octave. You can enjoy the notes of Gamelan through one of 4 waveforms to choose from.
If a note isn't sounding right you can simply detune the synth by however many frequencies you want (only use numbers).

The only struggle I had was the fact that I wanted to add reverb as an option but I could not figure out how to implement it in this short amount of time.

I used a simple synth tutorial to help with the structure but changed it by translating it to gamelan tuning.
