## Hell's Best Audio Visualizer

https://a4-tylersprowl.glitch.me/

This project is an audio visualizer of the song BFG Division from DOOM 2016. The goal was to create a simple audiu visualizer that could be ttweaked to include custom colors and display abilities. The challenges included my own coding skills needing some improvement in this field, and the difficulty of working with new frameworks and APIs. I learned a good amount, though, and enjoyed it immensely.
