This webpage provides an application similar to microsoft paint, where users can paint a picture and then save it to their computer.  Options include clearing the canvas, filling the canvas with the selected color, changing brush style and size, 
uselecting from preset colors, or choosing your own color with an RGB color selector.  The painted image can then be saved.  This application was built using Canvas, and the parameters users can control are described above.  Information
about functionality is shown in a popup when the page loads, and can be brought up again by clicking the link above the canvas.  Both the HTML and CSS validate.  I separated my javascript into three files for organization purposes.

The main challenge I faced was learning all of the syntax and methods for canvas, and implementing many of these options on the webpage.  Other than that the assignment was fairly straightforward.
