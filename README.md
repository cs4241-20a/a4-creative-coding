- Space Rock Truckers

My project is a 2D space dodging game made with Phaser3, a library that utilizes canvas for the drawing of 2D objects.
The goal of the application was to create a game that fulfiled the requirements of the assignment and was also mildly challenging
The biggest challenge I faced while developing this application was the lack of documentation that specified whether it was for Phaser 2 or Phaser 3 (because it isnt really backwards compatible code). 
There were many times that I tried to learn features of the library only to find out I was learning the wrong version.
