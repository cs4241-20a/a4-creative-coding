## Description of States for International Students

your hosting link e.g. http://a4-charlieroberts.glitch.me

Include a very brief summary of your project here. Images are encouraged when needed, along with concise, high-level text. Be sure to include:
This application provides a visualization of United States' states sized by the population. I am an international student in WPI, but it is hard for Internationals to remember all the states and their basic information. Thus, I decied to make a bubble chart for students to visually see the differences of each states. 
I have also referred to Bubble Chart from Observable : https://observablehq.com/@d3/bubble-chart. 

Goal: Show a visualization of US states and their information for international students who do not know American geography as much. 

Challenges: Scaling pictures on each circle was the hardest. However, also loading specific information from the json file was tedious work. 

Instructions: If you want further information, clicking on the circle will lead to the state's official government site.
