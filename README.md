## 2D Audio Visualizer

Link: https://a4-yaru-gong.glitch.me/

This is a 2D Audio Visualizer made with Canvas.js.

- Goal: The goal is to make a 2D audio visualizer that the users could modify display.
- Challenges: The web does not allow audio to auto-play, so I have to add actions before the song plays.
