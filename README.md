Etch-A-Sketch
https://a4-brittany-henriques.glitch.me/

The goal of my application is to give the user the nostalgic feeling of drawing on an Etch-A-Sketch pad, which also adding to the experience. Some challenges I
ran into while writing my application was the use of the arrow keys. I wanted to allow the user to make diagonal lines and had a hard tiem figuring out how to
code that into the program. I ended up using true and false states in order to keep track of which arrow keys were pressed. I also ran into a problem with the
help window and displaying it over all the other content. The z-index was proving difficult to fine tune exactly how I wanted it to be. Not everything turne out
exactly how I wanted it to be, but it came pretty close.
