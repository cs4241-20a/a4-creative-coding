## Goal
To create an interactive physics demo


## Challenges
I have not taken any courses in game design and it shows. I thought I would be able to learn enough to create the obligatory space game.
The challenges were overwhelming, I had difficulty loading 3d models, updating projectiles and getting my bearing in threejs.
I scaled back and implemented raycasting to select spheres, and used Physijs to create motion.
