## Fall Guys Minigame Frontend
http://a4-ioannis-kyriazis.glitch.me

The goal of this application is to be a front-end for my side project of recreating a Fall Guys minigame to be played online. I faced challenges when generating random colored
tiles and figuring out how to make the assignment satisfy the requirements.

- The server is an express backend.
- The assignment implements a canvas and draws different colored squares with a border.
- A user interface exposes six parameters for the user to change: the size of the tiles, the background color of the site,
the tile border color, the number of columns, the number of rows, and how many different colors to use.
- The '?' displays a help section.
