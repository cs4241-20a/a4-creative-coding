## 3D Sound Waves of "Monsters Inc. Theme"

https://a4-kyle-mikolajczyk.glitch.me/

For this project, I embarked on making a 3D visualization of a song's waveform generated in real time as the song played. I managed to create just this, using Three.js as the main driver. The big challenge to this project was learning the new framework of Three.js, dat.GUI for the display elements, and even finguring out how to get the waveform of a sound file (which I did not use a framework for other than methods built into the browser). Also, another challenge was cooperating with browser security which requires user interaction before a sound will be played. 

I enjoyed using the Three.js. It was really cool learning how to use dat.GUI to allow user interaction to rotate the screen and change Y and Z directions while viewing the waveforms. 

Quick note, when the song ends, there will be a pause and then the page reloads, sending the user back to the start screen.
