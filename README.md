This project is a visualization of music made by Web Audio API and D3. When clicking play music, the roll keys will change with the frequency of the music. User can change the volume and speed and color as they want.

When clicking the piano mode button, the keys will turn to a musical instrument that is interactive and can produce a music. 
  
Challenges I faced was to create a lot of divs. I tried to create them in a loop in javascript but it went wrong. I had to change it to be hard coded in html. 
Another challenge was that I initially want my application to be able to change music. I wanted to store the music in the database but it failed when I tried to send a response from the server. I did not find the reason still.
