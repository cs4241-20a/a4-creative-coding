## Virtual Piano

https://a4--jenna-galli.glitch.me/public/

This web application includes a piano made from Web Audio API's NexusUI. There is also a dat.gui portion where the user can alter the title header of the page in 6 different ways. 

- The goal of the application is for the user to play a virtual piano and alter a header to their preference.

- One challenge I faced included making the piano sound like a piano. To fix this I looked up the exact frequency of keys on a real piano and set my notes to those values. Another challenge was learning the dat.gui interface since I've never used it before. 

- The instructions pop up right away when loading the application. If there is a need to see them again, I included buttons you can click on.
