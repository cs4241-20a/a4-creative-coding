## Alex's Audiovisualizer
Alex Hunt - https://a4-alex-hunt.glitch.me/

For this project, I created a 2D audiovisualizer using Canvas and Web Audio API. As the song plays, it uses Web Audio API's realtime waveform analysis tools to make colorful balls bounce based on the amplitude (volume) at certain frequencies.

The goal of this application is to create an appealing visual based on a song in realtime. Some challenges I faced during development were:
- Interpreting output from audio waveform analysis
- Translating analysis output into a visual representation
- Implementing Javascript modules
- Implementing UI and linking it to Javscript to allow the user to customize the visuals
- Loading and playing an audio file from a CDN
