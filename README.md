## 1 Player Chess

https://a4-athammana.herokuapp.com/

This is just Chess in 3d. You can only play alone, because the client code is already a nightmare, so using that with server would've been so much worse. Basically you can select a piece and move it to a square that would be correct in a normal chess game. The 3d files were from sketchfab and made by 'moyicat'. After they were imported the pieces are cloned, placed into the correct places and then based in the selections and inputs they are moved and deleted when necessary. I faced a lot of difficulty learning Three JS because it was my first time using it. Importing 3d images was also kind of hard, but once I got used to it, it wasn't too hard. Finding the material to change the color for black pieces from the clones of the imports was very difficult. But I did find them eventually. And lastly, making all the game logic for the chess pieces was hard and buggy. But eventually I finished that as well. The website is pretty intuitive if you know chess. Just click a piece and then type the square that you would want to move them to.
