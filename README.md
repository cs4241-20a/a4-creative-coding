Sunflower Field
https://a4-victoria-buyck.glitch.me

My application plays three different songs that are sunflower themed and shows the frequencies on an analyer that changes colors. Some of the challenges I faced with
this application was the audio element compatability with chrome. It took a lot of digging in order to find a solution, and I had to use a couple different things that
I found in order to achieve it. Another problem that I ran into was getting all of the different elements to display the way that I wanted it to.
