## Pong

For this project I decided to create pong in 3D. The user can use w, s and all the arrow keys to manipulate
aspects of the game. I faced quite a few challenges. The first was getting familiar with THREE.js and understanding how it 
worked and how I wanted to do things. I also struggled a bit with game mechanics. For example the way the ball is reflected off 
the paddles needs to still be worked on.
