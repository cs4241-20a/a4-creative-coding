The Spinning Shape Simulator: Create Optical Illusions and Toggle Shapes to Trick your Friends!
------------

### GOAL: This simulator is for rotating shapes and adjusting their positions of rotation and size to create an optical illusion. At default, based on the rotation of the cylinder and the intersection with the cube, the cylinder appears to turn into a bouncing ball. In this simulator, users can change the parameters of the shapes to create other fun illusions and transformations.

## CHALLENGES FACED: I had a bit of trouble with learning some three.js functions, but other than that I was able to learn how to create fun shapes and animations with three.js.
