## Years in Congress

Jacob Tutlis https://a4-jtutlis.herokuapp.com/

This website provides a visualization of how many years each member of the US Senate and House of Representatives have been in office. Each bubble has a picture of the person, how many years they have been in office, color representing their party, and each bubble is clickable and will bring you to that persons website.

My main goal for this visualization was to allow people to see how long each member of congress has been in office. Also I really wanted to recreate Prof. Lane Harrisons [Exoplanets](http://codementum.org/exoplanets/) visualization.

My biggest challenge was trying to get each person's picture to display within their bubble.

Instructions:
To switch between the Senate and House click on the "Switch between House/Senate" button. It might take a few seconds to load the first time you click it.
Hovering your mouse over each bubble will update the text box in the top left hand corner with information about that person.
