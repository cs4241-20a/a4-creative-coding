## Customizable Tetris

This application is a Tetris game with some user-defined options. These options include color scheme, control setup, background music, falling delay, whether or not the speed increase throughout the game, and whether the game is played in dark mode. After defining settings, users can play tetris with their options enabled.  
I faced a number of challenges while making this game. One was allowing pieces to retain their color when they land. To do this I had to store all the previous piece objects as well as the currently falling piece object. I also had trouble getting the score badge to scale with increases in score, an issue which I fixed in the javascript rather than in the CSS.
